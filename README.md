# How the NBA All-Star Selection Works

* The NBA has an all-star game every year, and the players are chosen through a mix of media, player and community voting.
* There can only be 12 players from either the Eastern or Western conference
* There are 4 Backcourt players (Point guard, shooting guard)
* There are 6 Frontcourt players (Small Forward, Power Forward, Center)
* There are 2 Wildcards that can be any position
